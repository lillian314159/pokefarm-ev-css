# pokefarm-ev-css
Custom CSS for Pokefarm Q that puts borders around E/V pokemon

## exclusives_and_variants.css
Puts dashed borders around Exclusive and Variant pokemon and eggs. Exclusives are bordered in navy blue, Variants in purple. To use it, copy and paste the entire contents of the file into the Extra CSS portion of your site skin. (This is the only file in this repo you should need - the rest of the files are here because I used them to make exclusives_and_variants.css and thought I might want version control for them too.)
